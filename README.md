# Flutter Material App

This is my first Flutter project, demonstrating basic Flutter concepts such as:

- **Material Design Widgets**: Scaffold, AppBar, ElevatedButton, IconButton
- **Navigation Between Routes**: Navigator.push and Navigator.pop
- **Layout Management**: Row, Column, and Container widgets for alignment and spacing

## 🛠️ Features

- **AppBar with a button** for interaction.
- **Two pages** with route navigation.
- **Responsive layout** using rows and columns to position containers.
- **Interactive buttons** to switch between pages.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sevvalbilgi/flutter-material-app.git
